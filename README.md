# segment-chromeextension

Chrome extension tracking Segment-like events, so you can easily see what's being sent to:

- [Segment](https://segment.com/)
- Tracks all outgoing Segment-compatible API calls, and shows them in the extension.

## How to get started hacking

- Clone the repository
- Go to Chrome menu -> More tools -> Extensions
- Press "Load unpacked extension"
- Choose the folder you just cloned
- You can now hack away and test it live!

_Pull requests and issues are more than welcome._

Have fun!
